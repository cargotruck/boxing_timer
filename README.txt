The boxing timer is designed to be used as part of
an exercise regimen. Consult with your doctor before
beginning a new exerices regimen.

The user can configure the length of active and rest
periods. Set the length min and sec to 0 if the 
active or rest period of the round is not desired.
The user can also configure blitz periods,
which will randomly activate during the active portion
of the round. The user can configure the frequency of 
the blitz periods. Set the frequency to 0 for no blitz
periods. Set the min and max of the blitz to the same
time if the same length of blitz is desired each time,
otherwise the length of the blitz will be randomly
determined.
